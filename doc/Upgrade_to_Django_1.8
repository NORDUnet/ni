Due to migrations is now integrated in to Django you need to make a fake migrations before starting the app 

$ python manage.py migrate --fake-initial

Due to django.contrib.comments are deprecated you need to remove the old
comment content types from the ContentType table.

$ python manage.py shell
>>> from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
>>> for ct in ContentType.objects.all():
>>>     print ct.pk, ct.name

Look in the resulting list and delete the first comment and commentflag.

>>> ContentType.objects.get(pk=X).delete()
