Instructions how to upgrade an existing NOCLook installation to NOCLook 2.0

Start by setting up a Neo4j >=2.0 server.
Follow the instructions in the "Setup >2.0 neo4j db" document.

If you want to do this on a live machine make sure you got a recent backup of the data, both SQL and Neo4j.

Restore the SQL data from a previous dump if necessary.

Run "python manage.py migrate apps.noclook".
